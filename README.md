# StockAI-Tech-Stocks-Prediction-using-AI
A commercially available stock predictive model & research tool for time-efficient informed investments in the tech industry. 

### Project Description:  
At the intersection of the worldâ€™s most rigorous innovations and vast financial capital lies the potential to solve complex global problems. Affluent individuals in the US continue to benefit from specialized financial advisors to reap the benefits of the stock market, while the average citizen lacks the financial tools to do so. We aim to create an AI-powered financial advisor available to the masses, curbing the natural information gap between professional advisors and less informed investors in making informed investments in financial markets.

Through an intricate yet technically delightful infrastructure, we aim to harness the power of state-of-the-art deep learning models to synthesize quantitative fundamentals analysis and qualitative sentimental analysis for a holistic approach. Currently prototyping on the biggest company by market cap, Apple, we aim to fine-tune our research tool for the innovative, lucrative, yet rapidly changing tech industry.
